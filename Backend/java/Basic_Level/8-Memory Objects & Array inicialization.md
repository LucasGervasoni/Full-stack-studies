<h1 id="memory-objects--array-inicialization">Memory Objects &amp; Array inicialization</h1>
<p>Memory objects are some space in memory that is allocated to store some data, because this makes our code more scalable and saves more memory.</p>
<pre><code>//initialize with null  
String[] ninja = new String[3];  
System.out.println(ninja[0]);  
  
//initialize with 0  
int[] age = new int[1];  
System.out.println(age[0]);  
  
//initialize with false  
boolean[] areHokage = new boolean[1];  
System.out.println(areHokage[0]);
</code></pre>
