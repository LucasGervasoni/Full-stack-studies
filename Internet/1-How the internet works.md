<h1 id="how-does-the-internet-work">How does the internet work?</h1>
<h2 id="what-is-the-internet">What is the Internet?</h2>
<p>The Internet is like a giant spider web that connects computers, phones, and other devices all over the world. It allows these machines to talk to each other and share messages, videos, music, and much more!</p>
<h2 id="wires-cables-and-wi-fi">Wires, Cables, and Wi-Fi</h2>
<p>For the Internet to work, information travels through:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Internet cables (network wires)</strong> – like the ones that connect a computer to the router.</li>
<li><strong>Undersea cables</strong> – long wires that run under the ocean to connect different countries.</li>
<li><strong>Wi-Fi and cell signals</strong> – let you access the Internet without wires, like when you use your phone away from the router.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s like a super-fast mail service, sending packets of information through these invisible roads!</p>
<h2 id="ip-addresses-and-dns">IP Addresses and DNS</h2>
<p>Every device has a “home address” called an <strong>IP address</strong>. This helps computers find each other. But since big numbers are hard to remember, we use easy names like <strong>“<a href="http://google.com">google.com</a>”</strong> instead.</p>
<p>The <strong>DNS (Domain Name System)</strong> works like a phone book for the Internet. It translates website names into IP numbers so computers know where to go.</p>
<h2 id="packets-routing-and-reliability">Packets, Routing, and Reliability</h2>
<p>When you send a message or visit a website, the information doesn’t go all at once. Instead, it is broken into small pieces called <strong>packets</strong>.</p>
<p>These packets travel through different routes to reach their destination. If one road is too busy, they take another route, like cars changing lanes in traffic!</p>
<p>This makes the Internet fast and reliable. Even if one path is blocked, packets find another way to get to their destination.</p>
<h2 id="http-and-html">HTTP and HTML</h2>
<p>When you visit a website, your browser (like Chrome or Safari) asks for information from the computer that stores that site. This request is made using <strong>HTTP</strong>, a set of rules that websites follow to send text, pictures, and videos.</p>
<p><strong>HTML</strong> is the “language” used to build websites. It organizes text, images, and buttons, just like a book has pages, titles, and paragraphs!</p>
<p>If a website uses <strong>HTTPS</strong>, it means it has a security lock to protect your information, like passwords and messages.</p>
