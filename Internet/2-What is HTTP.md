<h1 id="what-is-http">What is HTTP?</h1>
<p>HTTP is like a mail delivery system for the internet. It helps your web browser (like Google Chrome) request information from websites and receive responses.</p>
<p>Imagine you want to watch a video on YouTube. Your browser writes a letter asking for the video and sends it to YouTube’s server. The server receives the letter, finds the video, and sends a response with the video for you to watch.</p>

<h1 id="how-does-http-work">How does HTTP work?</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>The request</strong>: Your browser asks a website for something, like a page, an image, or a video.</li>
<li><strong>Information travels</strong>: The request travels through the internet to the website’s server. It may pass through many computers along the way.</li>
<li><strong>The response</strong>: The server gets the request, finds the correct information, and sends it back to your browser.</li>
<li><strong>The page appears</strong>: When the response arrives, your browser organizes everything and shows the page to you.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="who-is-involved-in-this-process">Who is involved in this process?</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Client (user)</strong> → That’s you, using a browser to visit websites.</li>
<li><strong>Server</strong> → Like a big library of websites that stores all the pages on the internet.</li>
<li><strong>Proxies</strong> → Computers in the middle that help speed up delivery or block certain websites.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-does-a-website-load">How does a website load?</h1>
<ol>
<li>You type “<a href="http://www.youtube.com">www.youtube.com</a>” in your browser.</li>
<li>Your browser sends a request to YouTube’s server.</li>
<li>YouTube’s server responds with the website, sending text, images, and videos.</li>
<li>Your browser puts everything together and shows the website.</li>
</ol>
<p>This happens in just a fraction of a second!</p>

<h1 id="how-does-the-browser-understand-a-website">How does the browser understand a website?</h1>
<p>Websites are made of different parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTML</strong>: Tells what information appears on the page.</li>
<li><strong>CSS</strong>: Defines colors, styles, and element positions.</li>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Adds animations and interactivity.</li>
</ul>
<p>The browser reads all this information and builds the page for you to see.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="what-happens-behind-the-scenes">What happens behind the scenes?</h1>
<p>When a website responds to a request, it can say whether everything went well or if there was a problem. This is done using <strong>status codes</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>200 OK</strong> → Everything is fine! The page loaded successfully.</li>
<li><strong>404 Not Found</strong> → The site couldn’t find what you asked for.</li>
<li><strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong> → The website has problems.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="is-http-secure">Is HTTP secure?</h1>
<p>Regular HTTP is not very secure because anyone could see what is being sent and received. To protect information, we use <strong>HTTPS</strong>, which adds a layer of security so no one can spy on the data.</p>

<p>Besides websites, HTTP is also used in apps and online games to fetch information, such as messages and updates.</p>
