<p>1️⃣ <strong>Writing the Recipe (Editing the Program)</strong><br>
First, you write the cake recipe in a notebook. In the programming world, this means writing a program in a text editor, like Notepad. This file must have a special name ending in <strong>.java</strong>.</p>
<p>2️⃣ <strong>Turning the Recipe into Simple Instructions (Compilation)</strong><br>
Now, imagine you want a robot chef to bake the cake for you. But the robot doesn’t understand the recipe the way you wrote it. So, you need to turn it into instructions the robot can understand. This process is called <strong>compilation</strong>, and the program responsible for this is called <strong>javac</strong>. After this step, the recipe is in a special format called <strong>bytecode</strong> and is saved in a <strong>.class</strong> file.</p>
<p>3️⃣ <strong>The Robot Bakes the Cake (Executing the Code)</strong><br>
Now that the recipe is in a format the robot understands, it can start baking the cake. In programming, the <strong>Java Virtual Machine (JVM)</strong> does this job. It reads the bytecode and turns it into commands the computer can execute. That’s how the program starts running!</p>
